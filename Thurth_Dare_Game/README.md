## TRUTH OR DARE GAME

###### Rules:
  This game is played with at least two players. At the start of the game the host have to enter the amount of players. Afterwards, each player should enter his name/nickname to the program. Then, each of the players can choose between truth or dare by typing corresponding letter to the game console (t = truth / d = dare). The program will automatically choose a random phrase depending on user's input and will skip to an another player, and so on. 
  
###### ISSUES:
  
 - [x] - done    
 - [ ] - open

**TO DO**
  
- [ ] Fix bug with character input. Whenever user types > 1 character, the program bugs and prints several outputs instead of one. Concerned: "GAME LOOP" with `input` variable and in "MENU LOOP" the `numberOfPlayers` variable. 
- [ ] Fix bug when user writes for amount of players mixed type of data. For example, "1ds3". Program bugs and jumps directly to the "GAME LOOP".
